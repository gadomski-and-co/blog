## Project

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 16px;">The Purchasing and Inventory Control System (PICS) was created in 2015-16 by a team of Kate Gleason College of Engineering (KGCOE) students to help streamline the paper purchasing order process that was currently in place for the KGCOE Multidisciplinary Senior Design (MSD) teams. While the introduction of the PICS system has been overall beneficial since its inception, the heavy usage of the system within the past couple years has revealed some areas of improvement. It has been estimated that possibly 50% of users time on the PICS system could be saved with improvements to how PICS works and functions. Requested changes include: ability to edit Purchase Requests once submitted, ability to scan incoming package barcodes to link with RIT ID’s, moving the budget sheets from separate excel sheets to being directly located on the PICS system, and other changes to aid usability. Additionally, the documentation left behind by the original development team isn’t clear and easy to comprehend, leaving our sponsors with no way to understand how the current PICS system is set up and running. The aim of this project is to further develop the PICS system interface to be more readable, understandable, sensical, and usable for MSD students, as well as PICS administrators. This will not only save time for students, faculty, and lab assistants involved in the MSD program, but aid their process optimization efforts by removing the roadblocks and annoying time-sinks they’re currently encountering, freeing time to focus on creating the greatest projects and program possible.</div>
