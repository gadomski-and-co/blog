# About

## Project

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 16px;">The Purchasing and Inventory Control System (PICS) was created in 2015-16 by a team of Kate Gleason College of Engineering (KGCOE) students to help streamline the paper purchasing order process that was currently in place for the KGCOE Multidisciplinary Senior Design (MSD) teams. While the introduction of the PICS system has been overall beneficial since its inception, the heavy usage of the system within the past couple years has revealed some areas of improvement. It has been estimated that possibly 50% of users time on the PICS system could be saved with improvements to how PICS works and functions. Requested changes include: ability to edit Purchase Requests once submitted, ability to scan incoming package barcodes to link with RIT ID’s, moving the budget sheets from separate excel sheets to being directly located on the PICS system, and other changes to aid usability. Additionally, the documentation left behind by the original development team isn’t clear and easy to comprehend, leaving our sponsors with no way to understand how the current PICS system is set up and running. The aim of this project is to further develop the PICS system interface to be more readable, understandable, sensical, and usable for MSD students, as well as PICS administrators. This will not only save time for students, faculty, and lab assistants involved in the MSD program, but aid their process optimization efforts by removing the roadblocks and annoying time-sinks they’re currently encountering, freeing time to focus on creating the greatest projects and program possible.</div>

## Development Methodology

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 16px;">Given that we are going into this project with an already created system in place, we have opted to continue on with the project using an iterative / incremental methodology. The PICS system has been up and running for a couple years now, with changes primarily only needed in how accessible and usable the system should be for its administrators and users. With these details in mind, using an iterative methodology would be most beneficial in helping to continuously roll out and subsequently test features as they are implemented. The Iterative design methodology is cyclical in nature, focusing on bi- to tri-weekly releases which demonstrate the new features / changes included with each release.

Following the designated procedure of the iterative process, we have six main stages throughout our process lifecycle, two of which are only completed at the inception and completion of the project. The Initial Planning stage is used to get an idea for the project scope as well as a loose understanding of the requirements. The Requirements stage is used as a time to further pin down exactly what requirements we intend to work on during this project release. What follows next is the Analysis, Design, and Implementation portion. This time in the development cycle allows us to actually start looking at the internals of the PICS system, as well as think about how we want to implement a feature on our requirements backlog. After the system analysis has been conducted and the design has been considered, we finally take the time to actually implement our change into the system. The subsequent Testing stage allows us thoroughly test our recent feature implementations to weed out unintended behavior. In addition, this time also allows us to show the release to our sponsors for them to use, in order to give us feedback. The Evaluation portion permits us to elicit the feedback gained from our sponsors during their time testing our release. This evaluation time is also used independently by our development team to discuss how our release proceeded this time around, and if any changes in process or structure need to be made. The final stage, Deployment, is incurred after the Analysis, Design, and Implementation portion is completed, and is only reached when the team in definitively deploying their current release as their final product.</div>

## Metrics

### Time/Schedule Metrics

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 16px;">One of the most important roles of metrics is tracking a team’s progress towards completing a project, with respect to time and a schedule. We will be using the Estimated Hours of Work Delivered Each Cycle to help team to track progress and plan future iterations. This is congruent to the concept of velocity in Agile. After a few iterations we will look at what we delivered each iteration, the hour estimates we placed on the tasks delivered, and develop an average that we can plan future iterations on.

If the team does begin to slip schedule-wise, we have a couple metrics to help understand why we’re off schedule, and how to adjust. The Total Hours Logged per Cycle will be a good indicator of whether the team needs to adjust it’s estimates, or simply put more work into this project. We expect to log 100 - 160 hours total per cycle as a team, which breaks down to 6.25 - 10 hours per person per week. If we’re not delivering work on schedule, and hours per cycle is below our goal, as a team we know the solution is simply devoting more time to this project. If we are hitting this metric and still not staying on schedule, it’s an indication that we need to adjust our estimates.

As for the accuracy of our estimates, that can also greatly affect the project schedule. Which is why the last schedule metric is the Average Estimation Deviation. With every task delivered we will compare the estimated time for said task to the actual amount of time spent, and get the average for all tasks. With this the team can detect trends, whether it’s a tendency to overestimate or underestimate. From there we can decide to adjust our future estimations.</div>

### Project Management Metrics

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 16px;">Besides simply building the product requested by the sponsors, as a team we also must remain cognizant of other tasks surrounding this project. The team is using a technique known as the Four-Up chart to track project Progress, Plans, Risks, and Needs. This simple tool provides a surprising amount of visibility into the status and progress of the project. To ensure that we’re actively contributing to and maintaining this documentation, we will track the average number of bullet-points on each Four-Up chart. A healthy number of bullets means the entire team’s engaged and has a good understanding of the project from a high level.

Ultimately this system is being built for certain people, represented by our sponsors. Therefore frequent communication is a must to ensure that the team’s building the exact product that the sponsors need, and keep the sponsors clued in on the project’s progress. The Number of Emails between Team and Sponsors will be tracked, to ensure that a consistent flow of communication is occurring between the two parties.</div>
